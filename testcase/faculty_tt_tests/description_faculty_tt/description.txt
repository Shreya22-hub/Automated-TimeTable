his function generates a personalized timetable for a specific faculty member. It first checks if the uploaded timetables exist in the uploads/timetables directory. If the directory or files are missing, a flash message is displayed and the user is redirected to the faculty view page.

It then validates the faculty_name input. If no name is provided, it flashes an error and redirects.

Next, it calls the timetable generator function ft.generate_faculty_timetable(faculty_name, timetable_files) to generate the facultyâ€™s timetable from the available timetable files.

If the generator fails, an error message is displayed. If successful, the timetable workbook is saved as an Excel file with a sanitized filename (faculty_timetable_<faculty_name>.xlsx) and sent to the user as a downloadable attachment.

Any unexpected errors during file access, saving, or sending are caught by a try-except block, and a flash message is displayed.
