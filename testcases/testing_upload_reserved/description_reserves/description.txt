This function is used in the timetable software to upload a CSV file containing reserved slots. It verifies whether a file has been uploaded, checks that the file extension is .csv, and ensures that the CSV contains the required columns (Day, Start Time, End Time, Semester). If all checks pass, the file is saved, and a success response is returned. Otherwise, an appropriate error message is returned.

Input Description:

The CSV file must contain the following columns:

Day – Day of the week (e.g., Monday)

Start Time – Start time of the slot (e.g., 10:00)

End Time – End time of the slot (e.g., 11:00)

Semester – Semester for which the slot is reserved (e.g., 2)
